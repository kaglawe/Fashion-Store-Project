# Fashion-Store-Project
Final CDAC project using J2EE, React JS, MySQL, SpringBoot, BootStrap, CSS, HTML

The rise of e-commerce has disrupted the traditional retail landscape, making it challenging for local shopkeepers to compete with online giants. However, with the right tools, local shopkeepers can leverage the power of the internet to grow their business and reach a wider audience. The aim of this project is to develop an online marketing platform for local shopkeepers, which will enable them to promote their products and services on the internet, and reach a wider audience. The platform will provide shopkeepers with a range of tools and resources to create and manage effective online marketing. The project also focuses on developing strategies for promoting the platform and attracting a significant user base. The platform will be designed to be user-friendly, cost-effective, and accessible to small businesses. Ultimately, the goal is to help local shopkeepers compete with larger businesses by providing them with a cost-effective and efficient way to reach a wider audience and increase their revenue.
